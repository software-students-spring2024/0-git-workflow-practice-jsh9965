# Bug Disclosure
I read **[this artile](https://cepa.org/article/bugs-beware-uk-post-office-scandal-demands-software-companies-come-clean/)** about some of the issues caused by undisclosed bugs in post office accounting software.

I found this article interesting on the surface level as it is crazy to read about innocent postal workers facing prosecution for software bugs they had no control over.  Software bugs are natural, but can often be remedied; however, ignoring and suppressing information about bugs is evidentally dangerous.  It makes me wonder about the recent trend of 'software as a service', and how instances like this may play into it.  Building software once and shipping it means it may include possible bugs, and the company building the software is somewhat incentivized to ignore these bugs as once the software is sold, they may not get paid for bug fixing, and may not want their software to be known for bugs.  However, if development companies try to sell software as a service, they are then always incentived to fix bugs, though the pricing model is much less convenient for the customer.
