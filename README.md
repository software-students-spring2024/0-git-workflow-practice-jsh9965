# Bug Disclosure
I read **[this article](https://cepa.org/article/bugs-beware-uk-post-office-scandal-demands-software-companies-come-clean/)** about some of the issues caused by undisclosed bugs in post office accounting software.

I found this article interesting on the surface level as it is crazy to read about innocent postal workers facing prosecution for software bugs they had no control over.  Software bugs are natural, but can often be remedied; however, ignoring and suppressing information about bugs is evidentally dangerous.  It makes me wonder about the recent trend of 'software as a service', and how instances like this may play into it.  Building software once and shipping it means it may include possible bugs, and the company building the software is somewhat incentivized to ignore these bugs as once the software is sold, they may not get paid for bug fixing, and may not want their software to be known for bugs.  However, if development companies try to sell software as a service, they are then always incentived to fix bugs, though the pricing model is much less convenient for the customer.

The key takeaways from the article highlight a scandal involving the UK Post Office and Fujitsu, where faulty accounting software led to wrongful prosecutions. This situation highlighta the importance of transparency and accountability in software development. We should think about policy reforms to mandate bug reporting and independent audits, while incentives for transparent bug acknowledgment are crucial. Additionally, mandatory third-party audits can ensure unbiased verification of software quality. Policymakers must carefully balance concerns about software access with the imperative of transparency to prevent similar injustices in the future.

This article fascinatingly unveils the perilous intersection of software bugs and legal accountability, a sobering reminder of technology's potential to wreak havoc on lives when mishandled. The chilling tale of Fujitsu's flawed software leading to the unjust incarceration of hundreds of post office branch directors is not just a tech failure, but a stark illustration of moral and legal negligence. It's eye-opening how the concealment of software errors can cascade into a grave injustice, underscoring the critical need for transparency and ethical responsibility in technology. This narrative serves as a compelling call for stringent policies and third-party oversight in software development.
